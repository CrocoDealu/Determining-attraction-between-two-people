[Speaker A (00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.160)] How have you been?

[Speaker B (00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.240)] Good. Been great.

[Speaker B (00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.920)] So, I have a couple questions for you. Okay.

[Speaker B (00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.679)] Do you believe in God?

[Speaker A (00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.720)] I believe in like a higher power. I don't know if it's necessarily God, but like I'm feel like I'm a pretty spiritual person. Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520)] Um, but I was raised Catholic and I don't think I continue those beliefs.

[Speaker B (00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.480)] Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.760)] Do you believe in God?

[Speaker B (00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240)] I do believe in God. Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.400)] Is that a deal breaker for you?

[Speaker B (00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.920)] It's not a dealbreaker for me. would say like I love anybody, but I do think that I'm washed with the blood of Jesus Christ. With that said, I mean like I'm not perfect. So,

[Speaker B (00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.960)] I have another question. Uh, what's your drug of choice?

[Speaker A (00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.399)] Um, I love a stimulant.

[Speaker A (00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.840)] I I I've tried weed before and I think I just get a little bit paranoid.

[Speaker B (00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160)] Um, same. 

[Speaker A (00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.920)] It only feels fair that you can answer that back if we're going to go at it.

[Speaker B (00:00:57.920 --> 01:03.600)] I mean, if I'm honest, like I get paranoid all the time, but I still smoke weed very regularly.

[Speaker A (01:03:600 --> 01:05.280)] Very cool.

[Speaker B (01:05:280 --> 01:09.360)] Yeah, it's just tragic. Um, question. Okay.

[Speaker B (01:09:360 --> 01:14.479)] What do you look for? Like what are positive signs in a relationship for you?

[Speaker A (01:14:479 --> 01:23.439)] They are like empathetic and like care about other people. That's like a really big thing for me. Um, have a sense of humor, creative in a sense, even if

[Speaker A (01:23.439 --> 01:26.960)] they're not good at the creative thing, but like just trying. That's what I am.

[Speaker A (01:26.960 --> 01:30.159)] Like I I keep trying things. I'm not good at them.

[Speaker A (01:30:159 --> 01:34.799)] And then also just like a natural curiosity.

[Speaker A (01:34:799 --> 01:39.520)] Um I feel like curiosity is what like leads most my life is why I am literally here.

[Speaker B (01:38.960 --> 01:42.640)] You've had degree of openness. Degree of openness.

[Speaker A (01:42:640 --> 01:43.640)] Yes. 

[Speaker B (01:43:640 --> 01:46.759)] Okay. Um I'm actually I need to remember cuz these questions are important.

[Speaker A (01:47:360 --> 01:50.960)] Okay. If I is this an interview like do you want me to ask one back?

[Speaker B (01:50:960 --> 01:54.000)] You could ask one. Yeah. Go ahead.

[Speaker A (01:54:000 --> 01:58.640)] Okay. What does your average day look like? And like rate it one out of 10.

[Speaker B (01:58:640 --> 02:05.840)] Average day I would say like eight out of 10. Wake up midm morning and then either hop in the ocean or go workout.

[Speaker B (02:05:840 --> 02:14.480)] Then I'll usually go skate for a couple hours and then go to Hollywood where I teach skateboarding. I teach kids how to skate over
