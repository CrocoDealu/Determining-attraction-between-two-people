[Speaker B (01:18:320 --> 01:25.040)] So, um I think I would do my best to save you both, but like I feel like my wife would also be like screaming in the moment to be like you you should know what to do,

[Speaker A (01:25:040 --> 01:26.000)] right?

[Speaker B (01:26:000 --> 01:27.280)] And that would be saving you.

[Speaker B (01:27:280 --> 01:32.079)] Exactly. As I thought. As I thought. I feel this.

[Speaker A (01:32:079 --> 01:37.280)] I feel as if that took you long enough.
