[Speaker A (00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.039)] If you ever see a Direct TV or Jack in the Box ad, I probably had something to do.

[Speaker B (00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.199)] I literally went there last week. Oh, there we go. Can you get like discounts and [mumble] too?

[Speaker A (00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.000)] I wish. No. Oh, like the tiny tacos are so

[Speaker B (00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.800)] Yeah, I know. That's what always says.

[Speaker A (00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600)] Serious question for you.

[Speaker B (00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.840)] Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.520)] You know, like a Pringles can.

[Speaker B (00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.399)] Yeah, totally.

[Speaker A (00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.680)] Do you like dump out the Pringles or do you stick your hand in?

[Speaker B (00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.280)] Definitely stick it in, but then you start like getting towards the bottom and it gets a little

[Speaker B (00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.440)] What about you though?

[Speaker A (00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.399)] Yeah, I'm definitely sticking my hand.

[Speaker B (00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.800)] Okay, there we go. Yeah.

[Speaker A (01:00:800 --> 01:02.000)] I think I like the like sour cream one though.

[Speaker B (01:02:000 --> 01:04.080)] Okay. Yeah. I feel like that's probably the best.

[Speaker B (01:04:080 --> 01:05.439)] Or like the cheddar one.

[Speaker A (01:05:439 --> 01:07.119)] Yeah. Classic's kind of mid.

[Speaker B (01:07:119 --> 01:09.040)] Yeah. Classic's kind of mid. Yeah. It has to be like

[Speaker B (01:09:040 --> 01:11.119)] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker B (01:11:119 --> 01:14.640)] Um What do you do outside of work?

[Speaker B (01:15.760 --> 01:18.240)] You do box, too.

[Speaker A (01:18.240 --> 01:19.759)] Yeah. I did a boxing match once.

[Speaker A (01:19:759 --> 01:21.920)] So, that was my

[Speaker B (01:21:920 --> 01:24.240)] Did you win?

[Speaker A (01:24:240 --> 01:27.680)] I did. [laughter] Yeah, that was um I don't even know if that is going to be my wedding day, but

[Speaker A (01:32.560 --> 01:35.520)] Okay. Yeah, that was kind of hard.

[Speaker B (01:35.520 --> 01:37.040)] But, um, how long does that take?

[Speaker A (01:37.040 --> 01:41.280)] Honestly, I could rot my bed for like a long time, so I I did it for like nine hours, I think, once.

[Speaker A (01:41:280 --> 01:43.040)] What do you watch on TV?

[Speaker B (01:43:040 --> 01:44.640)] Oh my god,

[Speaker B (01:44.640 --> 01:46.799)] I don't want to get outed for that.

[Speaker A (01:46:799 --> 01:48.240)] What? What is it? What is it?

[Speaker B (02:08:479 --> 02:11.119)] Uh, I mean, I don't know.

[Speaker B (02:11:119 --> 02:15.120)] I mean, maybe. I believe it's like a lot of commitment, you know.

[Speaker B (02:15:120 --> 02:18.640)] Yeah. If my if my work gives me time off for it, I mean, maybe. Yeah. It depends on what show it is, you know.

[Speaker A (02:18:640 --> 02:20.959)] Um, where would you take me on our first date?

[Speaker B (02:20:959 --> 02:26.319)] Oh, I usually like to go get drinks on the first date and then kind of just like see what happens with the rest of the night.

[Speaker B (02:26.319 --> 02:28.800)] So, like just like a a fun little bar, like good vibe.
