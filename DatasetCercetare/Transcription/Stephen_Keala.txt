[Speaker A (00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840)] Thank you. 

[Speaker B (00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.500)] It's nice, I love it. 

[Speaker A (00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.340)] From Amazon. 

[Speaker B (00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.180)] Oh, shoot, yeah. 

[Speaker B (00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.240)] No, I'm like, Amazon is the place. 

[Speaker A (00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.560)] Are you into fashion? 

[Speaker B (00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.520)] I love fashion. 

[Speaker B (00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.040)] I'm a big fashion person. 

[Speaker B (00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840)] I heard you saying that you used to do music when you were young. 

[Speaker B (00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.680)] What did you do? 

[Speaker A (00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.520)] I made like, sad R&B music. 

[Speaker B (00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.800)] Sad R&B? 

[Speaker A (00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.640)] Yeah, it was like— 

[Speaker A (00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.480)] It's what I make now. 

[Speaker A (00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.320)] It was like during COVID, 

[Speaker A (00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320)] I was just in my room. 

[Speaker A (00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.240)] I was sad. 

[Speaker B (00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.080)] This was recent, okay. 

[Speaker A (00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.920)] Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

[Speaker A (00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.760)] I haven't made any since. 

[Speaker B (00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.580)] Okay, that's fair. 

[Speaker A (00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.420)] Do you make music right now? 

[Speaker B (00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.420)] I do, I'm a singer. I write a lot of sad R&B. 

[Speaker A (00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.580)] Did you grow up always by music? 

[Speaker B (00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.980)] I did. 

[Speaker B (00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.820)] I grew up singing in the church. 

[Speaker A (00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.180)] Okay, yeah. 

[Speaker B (00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.020)] That's my whole life. 

[Speaker A (00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.060)] Is music the dream? 

[Speaker B (00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.740)] Music is the dream. 

[Speaker B (00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.420)] But truth, so I'm doing it. 

[Speaker B (00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.860)] There's a show called "Lady in the Lake", Apple TV. 

[Speaker B (00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.900)] And my voice is the only female voice. 

[Speaker B (00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.020)] Yes, my voice is the only female voice throughout the entire series. 

[Speaker B (00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020)] And that was like my biggest accomplishment thus far. 

[Speaker B (00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.940)] And the composer is currently putting it up for consideration for Grammy nominations. 

[Speaker B (00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.860)] So I'm very excited. 

[Speaker B (00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860)] I just wanna know, this is a quick question. 

[Speaker B (00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.220)] What is your favorite thing about yourself? 

[Speaker A (00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.220)] My favorite thing? 

[Speaker B (00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.540)] It could be physical or emotional or— 

[Speaker A (00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.300)] I think it's that I, maybe it's not about me, but I have really good friends, I think. 

[Speaker A (00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.380)] I think I spend a lot of time— 

[Speaker B (00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.220)] With the people in your life. 

[Speaker A (00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540)] Trying to get people that really care, that I really care about and that have cared about me. 

[Speaker B (00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.060)] Love that. 

[Speaker A (00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.220)] So I recently lost my job a couple months ago, but I've been staying with my friends and stuff. 

[Speaker A (00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.100)] I'm glad you have the chance to talk. 

[Speaker B (00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.860)] If that's it, that's it. 

[Speaker A (00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.860)] I think we'll get a hug.
