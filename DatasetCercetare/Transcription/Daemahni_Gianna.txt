[Speaker A (00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160)] I'm nervous as hell.

[Speaker B (00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.400)] Really? You're lying.

[Speaker B (00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.680)] You're just saying that to make me feel better. 

[Speaker A (00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.240)] No, I'm not. So, you work at a gym. Do you like working out?

[Speaker B (00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.280)] I do. I love working out. I want to become a Pilates instructor. That's like my goal.

[Speaker A (00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.840)] Yeah.

[Speaker B (00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.960)] Yeah.

[Speaker A (00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.640)] Okay.

[Speaker B (00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.960)] Do you like working out?

[Speaker A (00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.880)] Yes. I was actually a personal trainer for a short period of time.

[Speaker A (00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.680)] I kind of just did it as a second job.

[Speaker A (00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.279)] Okay. Do you have any facts about yourself that might be interesting?

[Speaker B (00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.720)] That's a tough question. Um, I like photography.

[Speaker B (00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.040)] I do photography.

[Speaker A (00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.399)] Okay.

[Speaker B (00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.239)] Yeah. I haven't been doing it recently, but I want to get back into it.

[Speaker A (00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.800)] Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.360)] Um, I literally have a I have a camera that I bought. It was like a $600 camera and I use it like twice.

[Speaker B (00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.360)] For what?

[Speaker A (00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.239)] Photography. I tried to make like one video and it didn't go well and I was

[Speaker A (00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.760)] like, "Well, this was waste."

[Speaker B (00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.840)] Oh videography, not photography.

[Speaker A (00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.600)] Well, it the camera I got it does both.

[Speaker B (00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.280)] Wait, I have a fun question.

[Speaker A (00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.160)] What's up?

[Speaker B (00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160)] Um, if you were to be a fruit, would what fruit would you be?

[Speaker A (00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.399)] A fruit.

[Speaker B (00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.480)] A fruit. Yes.

[Speaker A (00:00:58.480 --> 01:00.680)] Is it bad if I say watermelon? 

[Speaker B (01:00.680 --> 01:03.680)] Why would that be? No.

[Speaker A (01:03:680 --> 01:07.360)] Uh, no. Uh, I'll just go with my favorite.

[Speaker A (01:07:360 --> 01:09.439)] I I'll go with my favorite fruit. Probably mango.

[Speaker A (01:09:439 --> 01:12.240)] I love mangoes. Yeah.

[Speaker B (01:08:960 --> 01:13.920)] I feel like you would be a mango! Yeah. You can have the same mango vibe.

[Speaker B (01:12.240 --> 01:15.280)] I would be cherries.

[Speaker A (01:15.280 --> 01:16.560)] Cherries. Why cherries?

[Speaker B (01:16.560 --> 01:20.400)] Yeah. I feel like I'm just biased because they're my favorite fruit.

[Speaker B (01:20.400 --> 01:22.400)] What do you think I would be?

[Speaker A (01:22.400 --> 01:23.400)] Cherries!
