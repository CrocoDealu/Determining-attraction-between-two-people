[Speaker B (00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.520)] You want me I can take them off (the glasses)?

[Speaker A (00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.160)] Yes.

[Speaker A (00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.600)] There we go.

[Speaker A (00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.719)] I need to know where your eyes are going.

[Speaker B (00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.759)] To your eyes. My eyes are staying right here locked in the whole time.

[Speaker A (00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.639)] Do that.

[Speaker A (00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.200)] That's perfect. Yeah.

[Speaker B (00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.320)] You ready? Yeah.

[Speaker A (00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.559)] Okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.520)] Okay. I can kind of see your eyes a little. I know. I know. Keep them.

[Speaker B (00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.840)] I was just super upset over there cuz you didn't come and swap me out. So, I was like, I might as well come up and steal.

[Speaker A (00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.920)] I could tell like you were like

[Speaker B (00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920)] did you see through my glasses? I was eyeing like this

[Speaker A (00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.039)] I I like felt it in my brain like you were like,

[Speaker B (00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.400)] oh yeah, you heard me over there. I was chatting a little.

[Speaker B (00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.320)] That's what happens. That's dope though.

[Speaker B (00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.360)] Yeah. I'm so sorry I don't remember your name.

[Speaker A (00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.640)] Giana. Giana.

[Speaker B (00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.840)] I'm Eli. Eli.

[Speaker B (00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.239)] It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

[Speaker A (00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.079)] It's okay. I didn't remember either. I have a really bad memory.

[Speaker B (00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.320)] Oh, word.

[Speaker B (00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.160)] No, I didn't mean it. She remembers. Haha. Just kidding.

[Speaker A (00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.000)] Anyways, um so so you did some uh or he did some personal training.

[Speaker A (00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.440)] You guys were planning on working out and

[Speaker B (00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.039)] Oh, for sure. Okay. Well, I think that you and I should probably go work out, too.

[Speaker A (00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.079)] Okay.

[Speaker B (00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.440)] So, okay.

[Speaker A (00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.079)] How often do you hit legs?

[Speaker B (00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.039)] I hit legs twice a week. Okay, that's good.

[Speaker A (00:00:59.039 --> 01:00.480)] Yeah, I do two, three.

[Speaker B (01:00:480 --> 01:02.160)] Two, three. Okay, we can hit a leg day or two. That's chill.

[Speaker A (01:00:960 --> 01:03.840)] Yeah. You promise you actually stick to it, though?

[Speaker B (01:03:840 --> 01:05.360)] Oh my god. Yes.

[Speaker A (01:05:360 --> 01:06.720)] Okay, listen. That's a valid.

[Speaker B (01:06:720 --> 01:12.240)] This is what I'm thinking. We got 5 seconds left. We're going to go freaking hammer some shots and then we'll we'll freaking go tap in.

[Speaker B (01:12.240 --> 01:16.320)] We'll go to the koozie and we'll chill out.

[Speaker A (01:10:000 --> 01:16.320)] The koozie for sure. For sure.
